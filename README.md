# SignalBox

SignalBox is a collaborative decision-tracking platform that helps product teams capture, discuss, and decide on important signals—so nothing gets lost in chats, docs, or meetings.


## Problem

Product teams generate signals like ideas, feedback, concerns, risks, and decisions while building products. These signals often live across multiple tools, lose context, get re-discussed, and lack a clear lifecycle.


## Solution

SignalBox centralizes all signals into a structured workspace where teams can discuss them in threaded conversations and track them through a clear lifecycle:

**Open → Discussing → Decided**


## Core Concepts

* **Team** – Private workspace created by a Team Lead
* **Project** – Groups all signals for a specific initiative
* **Signal** – Idea, Feedback, Concern, or Risk
* **Signal Lifecycle** – Open → Discussing → Decided


## Features

* Secure authentication & authorization
* Team and project management
* Role-based access control (Admin / Member)
* Signal CRUD with attachments
* Threaded discussions per signal
* Permission-based visibility
* Dashboard with filtering, sorting, and search
